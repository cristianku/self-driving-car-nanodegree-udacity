**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**
==================================

<http://www.udacity.com/drive>

Overview
--------

This project will detect the lane lines on the road Python and OpenCV.

OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many
useful tools for analyzing images.

 

List of the files
-----------------

**P1.ipynb** contains the Program code to run ( how to run see below )

**writeup.md** contains the explanation how the solutions to the problem has
been resolved.

 

List of the folders
-------------------

**Test_images ** contains the input images for the processing of lane detection

**Test_images_output** is the folder containing the processed images using
**P1.ipynb**

 

**Test_videos **  contains the input videos for the processing of lane detection

**Test_videos_output** contains the processed videos using **P1.ipynb**

 

**Writeup_images** contains the images for the writeup.md document

 

**How to run the code**
-----------------------

 

**Step 1:** Set up the [CarND Term1 Starter
Kit](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/83ec35ee-1e02-48a5-bdb7-d244bd47c2dc/lessons/8c82408b-a217-4d09-b81d-1bda4c6380ef/concepts/4f1870e0-3849-43e4-b670-12e6f2d4b7a7)
if you haven't already.

**Step 2: **Open a command line in the **Project folder **(**
**CarND-LaneLines-P1 )

**Step 3:** Open Jupyter Notebook

`> jupyter notebook `**P1.ipynb**

A browser window will appear showing the contents of the current directory.

**Step 3:** Run the code using SHIFT+ ENTER

 

If you don’t have Python / Jupyter Notebook installed, you can download Anaconda
Package:<https://www.anaconda.com/download/>
